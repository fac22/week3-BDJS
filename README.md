# Week3 - BDJS
Authentication


## Description
<https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/course/syllabus/apprenticeship/authentication/project/>

Your project this week is to build a web app that authenticates users and stores user-specific data in a PostgreSQL database.

### User stories 
#### Core 
- As a user, I want to: submit information to your site for anyone to see
- As a user, I want to: come back to your site later and see what I posted is still there
- As a user, I want to: be the only person allowed to delete my stuff
- Since this project is open-ended youâ€™ll need to write your own more specific user stories once you know what you want to build.

### Acceptance Criteria 
- Forms for users to sign up and log in
- A form for users to submit data only accessible to logged in users
- A page showing all the data
- A way for logged in users to delete their own data
- Semantic form elements with correctly associated labels
- A Postgres database hosted on Heroku
- Hidden environment variables (i.e. not on GitHub)

#### Stretch criteria 
- Tests for all routes
- A user page that shows everything posted by a single user
- GitHub Actions CI setup to run your tests when you push

### Example project ideas 
- Founders & Coders book sharing system
- Food / coffee recommendations around Founders & Coders
- Founders & Coders events calendar
